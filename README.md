Main reason of this project is to learn `useReducer` hook and how it can be used to architect the state of a react app. 

There is a downside here and it can be very crucial in larger applications, the whole App parent component re-renders when the state updates/changes but whith that the whole children components also re-render and that is bad for performance.
